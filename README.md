# FilterParseSearchParameters
This repository includes an example front-end website, and a back-end database, for demonstrating fully-dynamic filtering capabilities (column, operator, value). Fully protected from SQL Injection.

This is an enhanced version of FilterParseXMLParameters which is available here:
https://eitanblumin.com/2018/10/28/dynamic-search-queries-versus-sql-injection/

The new version introduces two new methods for dynamically parsing filter sets:
1. Json parameter sets.
2. Table-Valued Parameters.

As mentioned above, this repository also includes a fully-functional demo web app, implemented in ASP.NET Core MVC + Angular 4, to demonstrate the intended functionality on the front-end side.
